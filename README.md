Project: Global Cost of Living Analysis
1. Context and Objective: 
This analysis explores global variations in average monthly income and cost of living across different countries and regions from 2000 to 2023. The dataset includes economic indicators representing income levels, essential living costs, and regional differences. The main objective is to examine how income levels relate to living expenses and how economic disparities appear across regions. By conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), the study aims to uncover patterns that explain differences in purchasing power and affordability around the world.

2. Key Variables:
* Country: The name of the country where the data was recorded.
* Region: The geographical area to which the country belongs (e.g., Asia, Europe).
* Year: The year when the data was collected (2000–2023).
* Average_Monthly_Income (USD): The mean income per person per month in U.S. dollars.
* Cost_of_Living (USD): The average monthly cost of living, including essential expenses such as housing, food, and utilities.

3. Data Overview:
* Total Observations: 199 records
* Number of Variables: 5
* Time Range: 2000–2023
* Regions Represented: Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, South America

4. Insights
* Insight 1 - Relationship Between Income and Cost of Living (Scatter Plot):
  The scatter plot shows a positive correlation between Average Monthly Income and Cost of Living. Countries with higher income levels, such as Japan, Germany, and the United States, also experience higher living costs, while nations with lower income levels (e.g., India or Brazil) tend to have lower expenses. This suggests that as income increases, the cost of maintaining a similar lifestyle also rises, indicating a global pattern where earning power and living costs grow together.
* Insight 2 – Regional Economic Differences (Bar Chart):
  The bar chart comparing average income and cost of living by region reveals significant economic disparities. Regions like Europe and Asia have higher income and cost levels, reflecting stronger economies and urban development, whereas South America and Africa show much lower averages. This difference highlights unequal purchasing power across regions — residents in wealthier regions spend more, but they also earn more, while those in developing areas face tighter living budgets despite lower costs.
